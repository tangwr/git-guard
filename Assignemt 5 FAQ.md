Hi all,

Please find below the FAQ for Assignment 5. If you have more queries, feel free to email us

Question
Is there a limit to the number of contributors for the github links that will be given to us?
Apparently github api's /stats/contributors method only supports up to 100 contributors per page and does not support pagination. 

>>>
We will take note of this limit and will not ask to support for more than 100 contributors.


Question
Which one of the following scenarios is applies to GITGuard:
     1. Email list for any previously queried repository is saved even when a new repository is queried
     2. Email list is cleared each time a new repository is queried


>>>
Email list for any previously queried repository is saved even when a new repository is queried  -- 'good to have' if user allows the email to be saved 


Question
Can we have an example format of the email that we need to send?

>>>
Actually we would let you decide . Be creative with your email content and format. I think Donald mentioned something about including the time information . Could you check again in the document. 

Question
Can we use libraries that builds on top of D3.js?

>>>
Yes

Question
Are we required to deploy on a server?

>>>
It's up to you. You should make sure your project works first. Though, a simple server is better for easier testing.

Question
Do we need to implement an authentication system?

>>>
We will test on public repo, so it's not a must to implement authentication system.
